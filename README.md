A low abstraction file reader written in Java and C (using JNI), hence the acronym LAF. It's based loosely on RandomAccessFile in Java's standard library.

Note: This library is currently incomplete and only generates class and C header files.

## How to Build
The library uses Apache Ant.

To build just type "ant", to clean type "ant clean".
